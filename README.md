SUDOKU PROJECT
---
 
Welcome. The setup to this project was accomplished using https://www.andrewhfarmer.com/build-your-own-starter/#6-express as a guide

This is an application for solving Sudoku puzzles. It uses React to build the board and 
change its values. 

It is different from other Sudoku solvers because it allows the user to input images of 
Sudoku puzzles, and uses OpenCV to extract values.

The Application uses a Flask server.
